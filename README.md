## Datasets 
The datasets are not included in the GitHub, but here is some information on how to get them in order to reproduce our code.

### Twitter US Airline Sentiment
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data.
By running our process_tweets.py file, we separated the tweets into positive (pos) and negative (neg) files.
